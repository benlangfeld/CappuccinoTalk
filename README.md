## What is CappuccinoTalk ?

CappuccinoTalk is a Jabber/XMPP client built using the [Cappuccino](http://cappuccino.org) framework. It is inspired by [Psi](http://psi-im.org/), uses [StropheCappuccino](http://github.com/primalmotion/strophecappuccino) and provides some features interesting for XMPP developers.

## Quick Start

You will need to symlink or copy the Cappuccino frameworks into Frameworks/ - development is currently running off the Cappuccino master branch.
